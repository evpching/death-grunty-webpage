The ***/secret*** command lets you execute **commands that aren't shown** in Death Grunty's list of commands. To find out what these commands are, you can either guess a lot or ask around to see if someone knows a secret command.

### Usage Examples

No examples here because it wouldn't be a secret anymore, sorry. :(
