The ***/8ball*** command is exactly what you think it is: you ask Death Grunty a question, and he gives you a random answer. Like a real magic 8 ball, Death Grunty will give you three kinds of answers: postive, neutral, and negative. 

Some answers that Death Grunty responds with are mean, but he probably doesn't mean anything by it...

### Usage Examples

- Death Grunty giving a positive answer.
![/8ball command producing a positive answer.](../images/examples/8ball_1.jpg)

- Death Grunty giving a negative answer.
![/8ball command producing a negative answer.](../images/examples/8ball_2.jpg)
