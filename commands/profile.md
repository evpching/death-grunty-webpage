The ***/profile*** command lets you customize and view your player **character's textual info**, such as their name, class, race, and more. Some elements of your profile are for aesthetic/role playing purposes and currently have no affect in The World R:M. For example, while your class/race has no impact on what you can do in The World R:M, they **appear on the embeds** that show when you use certain commands.
