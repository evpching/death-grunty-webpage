layout: command
title: /grunty
---

The ***/grunty*** command lets you customize and interact with your pet grunty! You can change their **color**, glam them with **hats**, determine **what they say to other players**, and more! Other players can see your grunty when they view or talk with them. 

Your pet grunty can also level up by feeding them **grunty food**. Leveling up your grunty currently has no purpose, but that will eventually change in a future update.
