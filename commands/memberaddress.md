The ***/memberaddress*** command lets you view and send member addresses to other players. Member addresses are a mainstay of the .hack franchise and can be thought of as **friend requests or calling cards**; you can send your member address to another player, and they can accept yours by sending theirs or deny by ignoring it. 

The number of member address you obtain **increases your level** "artificially". For example, if you are level 15 and have 4 member addresses, you are technically level 19. Depending on how Death Grunty is configured for the server, **viewing someone's profile** also requires them to send you their member address.
