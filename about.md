## Background <a name="background"></a>
Death Grunty started development in 2020 to self-teach myself Javascript/NodeJS and develop a general-purpose bot for my friends and I to use on a private Discord server. Overtime, Death Grunty went through several rewrites and eventually became a general-purpose bot with a hint of RPG elements. 

As of now, Death Grunty is currently maintained and developed by me (Ethyn Valen); Death Grunty is also hosted on a private dedicated server thanks to an amazing friend of mine.
