## Who is Death Grunty? <a name="whois"></a>
Death Grunty is a multi-purpose, [.hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.hack) themed [Discord.js v14 bot](https://discordjs.guide/whats-new.html) that features a copypasta system, pet grunty customization, simple RPG elements based on The World, and more! 

Death Grunty is based on [Death Grunty](https://dothack.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Grunty) from [.hack//G.U.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.hack//G.U.): a NPC that specializes in managing guilds.

## What can Death Grunty do? <a name="purpose"></a>
Death Grunty's functionality can be split into two categories:

1. ### Community/Text Based Commands
Death Grunty provides commands that can liven up discussions and moments on your server. For example, use... 
- the ***/8ball*** or ***/random*** commands to make a decision.
- the ***/copypasta*** command to view and create copypastas of existing media or of your own creation. 
- the ***/emote*** command to emote via GIFs from the .hack franchise.
- the ***/bookof1000*** command to see how you rank against other players in your server.

2. ### Simple RPG Commands
Along with Death Grunty comes The World R:M, his recreation of The World built from his memories of players and the atmosphere of The World R:2. Players can participate in The World R:M through using...
- the ***/theworld*** command to input Area Word Phrases to adventure to and reap rewards.
- the ***/memberaddress*** command to collect member addresses that increase your power.
- the ***/profile*** command to customize textual info of your player character. 
- the ***/grunty*** command to customize and interact with your and other pet grunties.

Death Grunty also comes with basic moderation/admin commands that let you adjust Death Grunty's behavior on your server and manage your server's messages/users.

## Background <a name="background"></a>
Death Grunty started development in 2020 to self-teach myself Javascript/NodeJS and develop a general-purpose bot for my friends and I to use on a private Discord server. Overtime, Death Grunty went through several rewrites and eventually became a general-purpose bot with a hint of RPG elements. 

As of now, Death Grunty is currently maintained and developed by me (Ethyn Valen); Death Grunty is also hosted on a private dedicated server thanks to an amazing friend of mine.
